    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the noodles. Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Add the fettuccine and cook until al dente, usually 10 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup of the cooking water, then drain noodles well. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Season chicken breasts with Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Warm olive oil over medium-high heat in large skillet. Once simmering, add the chicken and leave for 5-7 minutes until bottom is golden-brown. Flip over, add in 1 tbsp of butter, and continue cooking for another 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer chicken to cutting board and let sit 3 minutes. Cut into 1/2 inch slices and tent with foil while you prepare the sauce.</li>
        <li>In the same pan on medium-high heat, add butter and cream, whisk until butter is melted.</li>
        <li>Add in minced garlic, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, salt and pepper. Whisk until combined.</li>
        <li>Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 3-4 minutes until it begins to thicken.</li>
        <li>Stir in parmesan cheese just until melted and sauce is smooth.</li>
        <li>Take sauce off the heat and immediately toss with noodles, topping with sliced chicken.</li>
